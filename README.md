# libgltext
This is a OpenGL ES 2.0 port of the text rendering library that's originally developed by fractious: http://fractiousg.blogspot.com/2012/04/rendering-text-in-opengl-on-android.html

Please see TexampleRenderer.java for an example usage of the library. However, the example code is modified directly from OpenGL ES 1.0 code, I cannot guarantee it will compile and run.
